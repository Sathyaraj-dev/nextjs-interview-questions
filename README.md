**How Next is different from other JavaScript frameworks?**

Next.js is a JavaScript framework that is primarily designed for building React applications. Here are some key ways in which Next JS differs from other JavaScript frameworks:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR), 
Automatic Code Splitting, 
API Routes,
Built-in Image Optimization,
Easy Deployment

**What do you mean by SSR?**

This is server-side rendering. This enables rendering on the server a client-side page app, and then we can send that rendered page to that client. These pages get loaded faster as the browser gets access to them sooner.
