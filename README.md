**What are the advantages of using Next.js over React?**

Next.js offers several advantages over React, including server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, static site generation, dynamic imports, optimized performance, and easy deployment. Additionally, Next.js supports built-in SEO and analytics, making it easier to optimize your application for search engines and track user engagement.

**What do you mean by SSR?**

This is server-side rendering. This enables rendering on the server a client-side page app, and then we can send that rendered page to that client. These pages get loaded faster as the browser gets access to them sooner.
